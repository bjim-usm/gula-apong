Our latest pride & joy. Introducing the first halal certified Gula Apong Syrup (Nipah Palm Sugar Syrup).  

This syrup is made from locally collected nipah palm sugar and processed with our own recipe.  

Taste it's smokiness, sweetness with a bit of saltiness derived from the pure gula apong in our product.  

Suitable as a sweetener in coffee, tea and even cocoa drinks. This syrup also can be use as ice cream topping, baking ingredient, or even as a sauce for your waffle or pancake.  

For a thicker texture of our syrup, just chill it in the fridge and you get a great sticky texture for a better topping presentation.
