### Ingredients:
- 1 cup sugar
- 4 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup rice flour
- 2 cups Apong sugar
- 3 cups warm water

### Steps:
1. In a bowl, combine the wheat flour and rice flour.
2. In a separate container, dissolve the palm sugar and granulated sugar in warm water. Stir until the sugars are fully dissolved.
3. Gradually add the sugar mixture to the flour mixture, stirring continuously, until the batter becomes quite liquid.
4. Strain the batter to remove any lumps, then let it rest for 2 to 3 hours or overnight.
5. Heat enough oil in a small pan for frying (since you can only fry one at a time).
6. Pour a ladleful of the batter into the pan. Allow it to cook until the edges begin to set and the surface starts to dry.
7. Flip it over and continue cooking until both sides are a deep golden brown.
