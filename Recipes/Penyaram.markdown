Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
4 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup rice flour
2 cups Apong sugar
3 cups warm water
Step 1: Mix wheat flour and rice flour first.
Step 2: Use different containers to mix and mix Apong sugar, granulated sugar with warm water. Mix until well combined.
Step 3 : Put the Apong sugar mixture into the flour container (Step 1), little by little until the dough looks quite liquid.
Step 4 : After that, strain the dough and marinate (or rest) for 2 to 3 hours or overnight.
Step 5 : After that heat enough oil to fry the fryer (use a small pan because you can only fry one fryer on 1 pan at a time).
After that, pour a ladle of the dough into the pan. Let it sit for a while until the dough liquid begins to lengthen and dry.
After that, flip it over, and let it sit for a while to make sure both surfaces are cooked until it turns dark golden.
